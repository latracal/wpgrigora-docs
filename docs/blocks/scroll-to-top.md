# Scroll to Top

After Turning on Blocks from Grigora's Kit Dashboard.

We can use Scroll to Top Block in Site Editor/Blog/Page from Toggle Block Inserter.

Insert Scroll to Top from listed Blocks.

Once Scroll to Top is inserted, select the Scroll to Top.

After selecting Scroll to Top , Go to block settings, in block settings we see Geenral, Styles and Advanced of settings and we'll be exploring them one by one.

## General 

**Show After Scrolling** : Here we have to define pixels for scroll to tops visibility using unit input, default value is 400 px.

Only show when scrolling up after toggling on the button, this will work on scrolling up.

Smooth Scrolling allows you to scroll smoothly.

**Icon** : Icon can be changed here.

**Size** : Size can be changed using text input. Value entered uses pixels as its unit.

**Position**

**Static** : By default, every element has a static Position, therefore the element will follow the usual page flow. If a left/right/top/bottom/z-index is set, the element will have no impact.

**Relative** : An element specified with the position attribute relative is positioned in relation to its default position. A relatively-positioned element will be moved from its default position if the top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties are changed.

**Absolute** : Absolute positions an element relative to its parent, affecting the layout around it.. The top, right, bottom, left, and z index properties provide offsets from the contained block's boundaries.

**Fixed** : When an element has position: fixed;, it is placed relative to the viewport, meaning it always remains in the same spot regardless of how far the page is scrolled.The element's position can be adjusted using the top, right, bottom, left, and z index attributes.

**Sticky** : A mix of fixed and relative position is sticky positioning. When the element reaches a predetermined threshold, it is considered as fixed positioned; before to that, it is treated as relative positioned.
